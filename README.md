# GitRacoon
GitRacoon is a project inspired by [gitrob](https://github.com/michenriksen/gitrob), and has the ability to scrape new github pushes for potentially sensitive data such as passwords, database dumps, and private keys.

#Disclaimer
As with all of my security projects,
**PLEASE** don't use this for shady activities, it's meant only as a research project.

#Installation
Simply clone this project into a local directory, and reference 'racoon.js' in an html file. The program will prompt you for a github API key, which can be generated via the [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/applications) feature in github. The program will then begin scraping github. Results can be viewed in textboxes on-screen, or in your browser's developer console.
